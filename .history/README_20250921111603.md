## üì¶ Installation & Local Setup

Since this app uses React via CDN, setting it up locally is very straightforward.

1.  **Clone or Download the project**
    ```bash
    # Save the index.html file to a folder on your computer.
    ```

2.  **Run a Local Server**
    Opening the HTML file directly in a browser may cause CORS issues. To run it properly, use a local server.
    
    **Using VS Code's Live Server Extension**
    Install the "Live Server" extension, right-click on the `index.html` file, and select "Open with Live Server".

3.  **Open your browser**
    Navigate to `http://localhost:5501` to view the app.

## üéØ Usage

1.  Upon loading the app, it will automatically fetch and display a grid of podcasts.
2.  Click on any podcast card to view more details in a modal window.
3.  The modal displays the podcast image, description, genres, and a list of its seasons.
4.  Click the "X" button or anywhere outside the modal to close it.
